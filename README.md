## Quiz Game
An Object-Oriented Quiz Game that gets questions from Open Trivia DB (https://opentdb.com/) by using the requests module.
The program displays the questions and accepts answers via buttons through the Tkinter module. 
The user inputs their answers using these buttons, and the program checks the answers, 
providing feedback by changing the color of the UI and updating the user's score.
